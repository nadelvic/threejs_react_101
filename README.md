# Three.js and react minimal project.
#### Author Nathan Delavictoire


## Description
A very simple project combining a minimal react env and a simple threejs scene apart from the react code. I wanted to have something 
simple that runs with react and contains a three js canvas. Three.js code is seperated from react component. There are dedicated files for
the management of the camera, the lights and the objects of the scene. This project is more of a starter, I will reuse it in other project
with three.js.


## Install
Use the command `npm install`

## Run
To run the project use `npm run start` 

## About the content
Some test where made with the lights, the camera and the object of the scene. Everything may be moved of course.
